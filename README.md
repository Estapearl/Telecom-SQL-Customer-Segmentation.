# Telecom-SQL-Customer-Segmentation.

## Project Background

NexaSat, a mid-sized telecom provider, delivers **mobile voice and data services through prepaid and postpaid plans**. The company was facing growing challenges in retaining customers and maximizing revenue from its existing user base. **High churn rates, unclear customer value segments, and limited visibility into cross-sell and upsell opportunities were slowing business growth**.

To address these challenges, customer usage and billing data was analyzed using SQL to uncover key behavioral patterns. The analysis focused on segmenting customers by **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), identifying revenue drivers, and surfacing opportunities for churn reduction through**.

### Insights and recommendations were provided in the following areas:

- **Customer segmentation and CLV profiling:** Grouped customers into High, Medium, and Low value tiers, helping NexaSat prioritize resources toward high-value clients while designing retention strategies for lower tiers.

- **Churn risk analysis and retention strategies:** Identified customer groups most likely to leave, enabling proactive engagement (e.g., offering support to senior citizens without dependents).

- **Revenue contribution and ARPU optimization:** Measured average revenue per user across segments to show which customer groups were driving profitability.

- **Plan-level performance and pricing opportunities:** Compared prepaid vs postpaid and basic vs premium plans to highlight which combinations were most lucrative or underperforming.

- **Upselling and cross-selling strategies:** Found opportunities to offer premium plans or value-added services (like tech support) to under-served groups, boosting both revenue and customer satisfaction.
