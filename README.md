# Telecom-SQL-Customer-Segmentation.

## Project Background

NexaSat, a mid-sized telecom provider, delivers **mobile voice and data services through prepaid and postpaid plans**. The company was facing growing challenges in retaining customers and maximizing revenue from its existing user base. **High churn rates, unclear customer value segments, and limited visibility into cross-sell and upsell opportunities were slowing business growth**.

To address these challenges, customer usage and billing data was analyzed using SQL to uncover key behavioral patterns. The solution combined three key strategies:

- **Customer segmentation:** Grouping customers into Low, Medium, and High CLV categories to identify high-value opportunities.

- **Upselling:** encouraging customers to move from Basic to Premium plans, unlocking higher revenue potential.

  **Cross-selling:** promoting complementary services such as multiple lines and tech support, boosting overall ARPU and engagement.

This structured approach enabled NexaSat to focus resources where they matter most, driving revenue growth while improving customer loyalty.

### Insights and recommendations were provided in the following areas:

- **Customer segmentation and CLV profiling:** Grouped customers into High, Medium, and Low value tiers, helping NexaSat prioritize resources toward high-value clients while designing retention strategies for lower tiers.

- **Churn risk analysis and retention strategies:** Identified customer groups most likely to leave, enabling proactive engagement (e.g., offering support to senior citizens without dependents).

- **Revenue contribution and ARPU optimization:** Measured average revenue per user across segments to show which customer groups were driving profitability.

- **Plan-level performance and pricing opportunities:** Compared prepaid vs postpaid and basic vs premium plans to highlight which combinations were most lucrative or underperforming.

- **Upselling and cross-selling strategies:** Found opportunities to offer premium plans or value-added services (like tech support) to under-served groups, boosting both revenue and customer satisfaction.
